# README

This repository contains the project for Data Science for Economics and Finance 871 at Stellenbosch University.

The project attempted to model Covid-19 the daily new cases in South Africa and forecast ahead two weeks. ARIMA and LSTM neural networks were used for modelling. Google Cloud Computes Big Query and Virtual Machines were also used to improve speed of training.

For this project I received the top grade in the course of 100%. This contributed to a final mark of 92% for the module.
